## 2. Introduction

Walking is the most reliable, easy and healthy way to travel. Yet today the number of children walking to school is in decline. This has damaging consequences for our children’s health, safety and wellbeing.
Over 70 per cent of today’s parents walked to school when they were children but less than half of children walk to school today. Meanwhile, the number of children being driven to school is growing, with an increasingly negative impact on congestion, health and communities [1].

Walking is an easy, free and healthy way for children to get to school or other activities such as libraries, cultural and hobby centers, playgrounds e. t. c. Walking provides a lot of benefits for every one. 

To value pedestrian accessibility with have to decide what common points of interest (POI) have children in their weakly routine. From every place in the particular city we have to calculate five shortest routes to this POIs.  We have to decide what is suitable walking distance for  selected age group. We have to compare all found distances with this reference distance. POis with distances which is higher have to be decided as less pedestrian accessible as POIs which is lower then reference. 

### 1.3 Interest

This research can is interested  for both public and private sector. The public sector might care about neighborhood development , the values to comfortability derived from amending build new school, kinder garden or opening a  cultural center.
