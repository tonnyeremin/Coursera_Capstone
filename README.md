# Prague Pedestrian Accessibility

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Walking is the most reliable, easy and healthy way to travel. Yet today the number of children walking to school is in decline. This has damaging consequences for our children’s health, safety and wellbeing.
Over 70 per cent of today’s parents walked to school when they were children but less than half of children walk to school today. Meanwhile, the number of children being driven to school is growing, with an increasingly negative impact on congestion, health and communities [1].

Walking is an easy, free and healthy way for children to get to school or other activities such as libraries, cultural and hobby centers, playgrounds e. t. c. Walking provides a lot of benefits for every one:

- It helps to achieve daily  physical activity target for children
- Physical active children are more alert and ready to learn
- Through improved physical and mental health for
  children and parents 
- Parents could save money if children walked rather then going by car
- Walking boosts local business
- Healthy children means lower health spent for local authorities
- The school run generates two million tones of CO2 every year.
- Converting car journeys to walking improves local air quality and contributes globally to a reduction in carbon emissions.

### 1.2 How we can value current pedestrian accessibility of the particular city?

To value pedestrian accessibility with have to decide what common points of interest (POI) have children in their weakly routine. From every place in the particular city we have to calculate five shortest routes to this POIs.  We have to decide what is suitable walking distance for  selected age group. We have to compare all found distances with this reference distance. POis with distances which is higher have to be decided as less pedestrian accessible as POIs which is lower then reference 

### 1.3 Interest

This research can is interested  for both public and private sector. The public sector might care about neighborhood development , the values to comfortability derived from amending build new school, kinder garden or opening a  cultural center.
