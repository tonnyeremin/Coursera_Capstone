# Prague Pedestrian Accessibility

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Walking is the most reliable, easy and healthy way to travel. Yet today the number of children walking to school is in decline. This has damaging consequences for our children’s health, safety and wellbeing.
Over 70 per cent of today’s parents walked to school when they were children but less than half of children walk to school today. Meanwhile, the number of children being driven to school is growing, with an increasingly negative impact on congestion, health and communities [1].

Walking is an easy, free and healthy way for children to get to school or other activities such as libraries, cultural and hobby centers, playgrounds e. t. c. Walking provides a lot of benefits for every one:

- It helps to achieve daily  physical activity target for children
- Physical active children are more alert and ready to learn
- Through improved physical and mental health for
  children, parents and carers,
- Parents could save money if children walked rather then going by car
- Walking boosts local business
- Healthy children lower health spent for local authorities
- The school run generates two million tones of CO2 every year.
- Converting car journeys to walking improves local air quality and contributes globally to a reduction in carbon emissions.

### 1.2 Problem. How we can value current pedestrian accessibility of the particular city. 

To achieve our goal "Make cities comfortable for  walking" First off all, we have to decide, what we mean under pedestrian accessibility. As an example we took a middle age couple with two or more children, living in the city of Prague. We have to research their daily needs and decide  witch neighbor of  Prague is most suitable for them. Of course I understand that needs can vary and I have to count all possible points of interest (POI) to cover all humans daily needs.  But for the first step I decided to research this types of POI:

- Schools
- Kinder gardens
- Grocery stores
- Libraries and cultural centers

Basing on this research we can perform clustering of all Prague`s neighborhoods and build a model of the Prague pedestrian accessibility.

### 1.3 Interest

This research can is interested  for both public and private sector. The public sector might care about neighborhood development , the values to comfortability derived from amending build new school, kinder garden or opening a  cultural center.
